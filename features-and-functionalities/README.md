Backend Features & Functionalities
The backend of the Airbnb Clone project is designed to support the full functionality of a rental marketplace. This includes secure user authentication and authorization, property listing management for hosts, robust search and filtering mechanisms, a booking system with date validation to prevent double bookings, and integrated payment processing for guest transactions and host payouts. Additional features include a review and rating system, a notification service for updates and alerts, and an admin dashboard for overseeing users, listings, bookings, and payments. Together, these features aim to provide a scalable, secure, and responsive backend to power the platform effectively.
