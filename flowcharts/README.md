üóÇÔ∏è Property Booking Flowchart
The Property Booking Flowchart illustrates the step-by-step logic behind the booking process on the Airbnb Clone platform. It begins with a logged-in user searching for available properties and selecting a preferred listing. The system checks the selected dates for availability. If the property is not available, the process ends with an error message; if it is, the user proceeds to enter booking details and initiate payment. Once the payment is successfully processed, the system stores the booking in the database and sends confirmation notifications to both the guest and the host. This flowchart clearly outlines how user actions trigger backend processes and how data flows through various decision points, ensuring a seamless and logical booking experience
