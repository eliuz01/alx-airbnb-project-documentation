User stories help translate the system's functional requirements into concise, human-centered goals that describe what different users want to accomplish. These stories are derived from the use case diagram and reflect how each user type — Guests, Hosts, and Admins — interact with the system.
Each story follows the format:
“As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].”
This makes it easier to understand how the system should behave from the perspective of the end users.
