Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) provides a visual representation of how data moves through the backend of the Airbnb Clone system. It highlights the interactions between external entities, core system processes, and internal data stores â€” offering a clear overview of how backend operations are structured and connected.

ðŸ“Œ Key Elements in the Diagram
External Entities:
The diagram includes three key user types:

Guest â€“ interacts with features like booking, payments, and notifications.

Host â€“ manages property listings and receives booking payouts.

Admin â€“ oversees system-wide operations such as user and payment monitoring.

Core Processes:
These represent the major backend modules and functionalities:

User Management â€“ handles registration, authentication, and profile updates.

Property Listings â€“ allows hosts to create and manage property data.

Booking Management â€“ manages reservation requests, availability, and status tracking.

Payments Processing â€“ supports secure guest payments and host payouts.

Notifications System â€“ dispatches booking confirmations, alerts, and system updates.

Data Stores:
Each process connects to a dedicated database component where persistent information is stored:

User Database, Property Database, Booking Database, Payments Database, and Notification Log.

ðŸ§­ Purpose of the Diagram
This DFD serves as a blueprint for backend design by:
Demonstrating how data flows between users and backend processes.
Clarifying which system modules are responsible for which operations.
Supporting planning for database schema design, API development, and role-based access control.
