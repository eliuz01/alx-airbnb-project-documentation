Use Case Diagram
The Use Case Diagram provides a high-level visual representation of how different users interact with the system. It captures the key actors — Guest, Host, and Admin — and maps out the core functionalities they are involved in, such as user registration, property listing, booking, and payment management. This diagram helps communicate system behavior and user-system relationships in a way that is easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It ensures that all critical interactions are identified and supports the planning and implementation of user-centered features
